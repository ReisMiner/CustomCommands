# CustomCommands
Funny Discord Bot :)

# How To use it for ur own server?
-1. Make a new App on the Discord dev portal (Google it), make it a bot and invite it with admin privileges to your server.
0. Yoink this Repo via clone. In IntelliJ you can just create a new project from Version Control to do so. The IDE will then create a Gradle Project and download all the libraries used.
1. Make a Token.java with following fields: TOKEN, prefix, sendreacts, shutImg.
2. If you got a Database to store all your userdefined commands add DBurl, DBusername and DBpassword too. If you got no databse then good luck removing all that stuff. Basically its just deleting the DB package in commands and then you'll see all the errors :)
3. Give the fields a value which corresponds with your data so you have working credentials.
4. Try starting the Bot :)

# Help me. I get error and cannot start the bot

# FAQ
1. Why do the instructions begin counting at -1? -> Because I was too lazy to make the list new. I forgot the step -1
